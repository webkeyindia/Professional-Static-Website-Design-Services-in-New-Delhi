What is a Static Website?

A static website is a simple yet powerful type of website where each page is delivered exactly as designed, without real-time content changes. Built using HTML, CSS, and lightweight JavaScript, static websites do not depend on databases or complex backend systems. This makes them exceptionally fast, stable, and secure. Static websites are perfect for businesses that need a strong online presence through informational pages, portfolios, landing pages, or corporate profiles with fixed content.
